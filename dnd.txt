How combat works 
* How to determine if an attack was successful 
* skill points assigned to a specific weapon are also given to the skill value in the weapon group
** The weapon group has a lower return of value per allocated point from points allocated towards a 
** specific weapon. This allows a character to specialize in one weapon, but still have a general proficiency
** in other, similar, weapons that belong to the same group.
* How to determine if you dodged an attack
* Crits should be rare (special)
** Consider special modifier (mini-crit?) a bonus to strive for
* Fighting defensively 
* movement in combat
* advantageous and disadvantageous combat scenarios

** concealment
* special attacks
